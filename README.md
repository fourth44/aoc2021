# Advent Of Code 2021

Disclaimers:

 - As the inputs are well-formatted, I enjoy to employ code golf to spend minimum effort to parse it. Readability of parsing logic is not a priority here (normally it would be!)
 - While at it, I also enjoy code golf for the solutions... Bad me!
 - Functional programming FTW. No mutability.
